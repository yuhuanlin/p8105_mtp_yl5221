## Problem 1 - Data

The raw data includes date, weight of three dogs and the standard
object, notes describing their locations and special occasions. My goals
of report is to seperate text and weight data into two seperate csv and
do data wrangling, visualization for the weight data.

When date is imported from excel, it shows at numeric value of days
starting from 1899-12-30. I used the as.Date function to provide correct
expression of date column. The weight of dog is given by Lbs Oz. We need
to convert it into single unit for convenience of analyzing. Here I
converted them into lbs weight of each dog. The resulting df contains
date and lbs weight of each dog during observation.

For the text part, date column is a subcolumn. I imported the data and
drop the first row, then rename the first column - date.

``` r
weight_df =
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07may2022.xlsx", range = ("B2:F363")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date = as.numeric(date)) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, origin = "1899-12-30")) %>% 
  separate(raisin, into = c("r_lbs", "r_oz"), sep = 2) %>% 
  separate(simone, into = c("s_lbs", "s_oz"), sep = 2) %>% 
  separate(gagne, into = c("g_lbs", "g_oz"), sep = 2) %>% 
  separate(std, into = c("std_lbs", "std_oz"), sep = 2) %>%
  mutate_if(is.character,as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(r_oz = r_oz/16, s_oz = s_oz/16, g_oz = g_oz/16, std_oz = std_oz/16) %>% 
  mutate(raisin = r_oz + r_lbs, simone = s_oz + s_lbs, gagne = g_oz + g_lbs, std = std_oz + std_lbs) %>% 
  select(date, raisin, simone, gagne, std)
```
